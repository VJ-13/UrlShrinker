The URL-Shrinker is a dynamic and efficient web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to provide users with a simple and secure way to shorten long URLs. This website showcases my proficiency in managing data and seamlessly integrating it into a functional web interface.

With URLShrinker, users can input lengthy web addresses and receive shortened URLs in return.
